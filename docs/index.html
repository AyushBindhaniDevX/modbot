            <p><b>Discord</b> is an all-in-one voice and text chat originally created <abbr title="to hang out around its hundreds of online communities, ">for gamers,</abbr>but now used by all since it's free, secure, and works on any desktop (using their dedicated <abbr title="compatible with Linux, Mac, and Windows">client</abbr>), or <abbr title="Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safary, Chrome">web browser</abbr>, as well as on your <abbr title="Android or iOS">smartphone</abbr>, which guarantees that the fun can continue even while you are on-the-go, or off on vacation.</p>
            <p>Imagine all the advantages and benefits of WhatsApp™, TeamSpeak™, Skype™, plus the control of the good 'ol message boards.</p>
            <p>Well, now you can stop imagining and start enjoying them in a single app!</p>
            <p>You don't have to share your private phone number or email to connect with people as some apps, like WhatsApp, force you to. And you can stop paying for TeamSpeak servers to keep in touch with friends. No more hassling with Skype either, or having to hunt for any sketchy ways to communicate and share with friends, or your new chosen family. Simplify your life and Join the Revolution!</p>

            <p>Once you are ready, get your instace of ModBot using Heroku, or invite our <a href="#x" title="ModBot">Official Bot</a></p>
